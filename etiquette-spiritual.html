              <h2>Common Spiritual Questions</h2>

              <h3>What if I'm not Hindu/of this faith?</h3>
              <p>Temples welcome visitors of all faiths. Hinduism is philosophically inclusive. You can respect and participate without converting or adopting beliefs.</p>

              <h3>Can I ask the priest questions?</h3>
              <p>Yes! Most priests love explaining. Respectfully ask: "Can you explain what's happening?" Most will happily teach.</p>

              <h3>What if I don't understand Sanskrit?</h3>
              <p>The vibration and intention matter more than understanding words. Experience the energy; meaning will come through presence.</p>

              <h3>Is it disrespectful to not participate fully?</h3>
              <p>No. Observing respectfully is completely acceptable. You participate to your comfort level.</p>

              <h3>Can I meditate in the temple?</h3>
              <p>Yes, absolutely. Find a quiet corner and sit respectfully. Temples are places for meditation.</p>

              <h3>What about other faiths' temples?</h3>
              <p>Same principles: remove shoes, dress modestly, be respectful. Gurdwaras (Sikh), mosques (Muslim), and other temples may have specific customs; ask staff.</p>

              <h3>How do I know what to do if I'm unsure?</h3>
              <p>Watch others and follow their lead. Or ask temple staff: "What should I do?" People are happy to help visitors.</p>

              <p>Spiritual etiquette during Diwali is about respect, openness, and genuine interest. You don't need to be Hindu, spiritual, or religious to participate meaningfully. You just need to approach with reverence and willingness to experience something sacred.</p>

              <p><strong>Approach with an open heart. Respect the sacred. Experience the light.</strong></p>
