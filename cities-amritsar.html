              <h2>Amritsar Diwali — An Overview</h2>
              <p>Amritsar is home to the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib), Sikhism's holiest shrine. During Diwali, this marble-and-gold structure gleaming against the night sky is genuinely one of the most beautiful sights in the world.</p>
              <p>What makes Amritsar unique is the profound multi-faith nature of the celebration. While Diwali is traditionally Hindu, the Golden Temple celebrates with equal enthusiasm, and people of all faiths are welcomed with the same warmth and reverence. The temple's free langar (community kitchen) feeds thousands daily, regardless of faith or background.</p>
              <p>Diwali in Amritsar is also Bandi Chhor Divas for Sikhs — celebrating freedom from oppression through the legend of Guru Hargobind Ji's release from imprisonment.</p>

              <h2>The Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib)</h2>
              <h3>Understanding the Temple</h3>
              <p>The Golden Temple is the holiest shrine in Sikhism. Built in 1601, it stands in the center of a sacred pool called Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar). The temple is covered in gold leaf and surrounded by white marble — a stunning architectural achievement.</p>
              <p>The temple is open to people of all faiths. Visitors are welcomed with tremendous warmth. The guiding principle is "Langar" — free community meals offered to all, regardless of religion, caste, or social status.</p>

              <h3>During Diwali</h3>
              <p>The temple is illuminated with thousands of lights. The reflection on the sacred pool creates a mirror-like effect of glowing gold. It's simultaneously peaceful and energetic — a profound spiritual atmosphere mixed with celebration.</p>

              <h2>Bandi Chhor Divas — The Sikh Celebration</h2>
              <h3>What is Bandi Chhor Divas?</h3>
              <p>Bandi Chhor Divas (imprisonment day release) celebrates the freedom of Guru Hargobind Singh Ji from imprisonment in Gwalior Fort in 1619. He was imprisoned unjustly by the Mughal emperor but was released on the new moon day of Kartik (same as Diwali).</p>
              <p>The celebration involves:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Lighting lamps (diyas) symbolizing freedom</li>
                <li>Setting off fireworks</li>
                <li>Wearing new clothes</li>
                <li>Family gatherings and feasts</li>
                <li>Religious prayers at the Golden Temple</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>How It Merges with Diwali</h3>
              <p>Since Bandi Chhor Divas and Diwali fall on the same day, the celebration is a beautiful blend of two traditions. Hindu devotees celebrate the triumph of good over evil; Sikh devotees celebrate freedom from oppression. Both themes resonate together perfectly.</p>
