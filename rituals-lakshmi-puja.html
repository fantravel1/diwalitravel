            <section class="article-section">
              <h2>Who is Goddess Lakshmi?</h2>
              <h3>The Goddess</h3>
              <p>Lakshmi (also spelled Laxmi) is one of Hinduism's principal goddesses. She is the consort of Vishnu, the preserver god, and is revered across all Hindu traditions.</p>

              <h3>Iconography &amp; Symbols</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Usually depicted as a beautiful woman with golden complexion</li>
                <li><strong>Lotus:</strong> Sits on a lotus flower (symbol of purity and divine beauty)</li>
                <li><strong>Gold coins:</strong> Rains gold coins from her hands (prosperity)</li>
                <li><strong>White elephants:</strong> Often accompanied by them (wisdom and steadiness)</li>
                <li><strong>Red dress:</strong> Wears red or gold clothing (auspiciousness)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>What She Represents</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Material prosperity:</strong> Wealth, money, resources</li>
                <li><strong>Spiritual prosperity:</strong> Inner wealth, contentment, peace</li>
                <li><strong>Health:</strong> Physical well-being and vitality</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Intellectual and wisdom prosperity</li>
                <li><strong>Good fortune:</strong> Luck, blessings, grace</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Lakshmi in Hindu Philosophy</h3>
              <p>Lakshmi represents the principle that prosperity comes to those who work hard, stay virtuous, and deserve it through good karma. She can leave those who become lazy, arrogant, or unethical. Thus, Lakshmi Puja is as much about inviting good values as inviting material wealth.</p>

              <h2>When is Lakshmi Puja Performed?</h2>
              <h3>Diwali Timing</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Date in 2026:</strong> November 8, 2026 (Sunday)</li>
                <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Evening time, after sunset</li>

                <li><strong>New Moon (Amavasya):</strong> Darkest night; Lakshmi appears with lights</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Why Evening?</h3>
              <p>Lakshmi Puja is performed in the evening because of the symbolism: during the dark new moon night, lamps are lit to welcome Lakshmi. The darkness represents ignorance and poverty; the lights represent knowledge and prosperity.</p>

              <h2>The Symbolism of Lakshmi Puja</h2>

              <h3>Light Over Darkness</h3>
              <p>The dark new moon night (Amavasya) represents ignorance and darkness. Lighting lamps represents knowledge, enlightenment, and the arrival of prosperity. This is why Diwali is called the "Festival of Lights."</p>

              <h3>Cleanliness &amp; Purity</h3>
              <p>Houses are thoroughly cleaned before Lakshmi's arrival. This symbolizes removing negativity, bad habits, and impurity — both physical and spiritual. A clean heart and mind are needed to receive Lakshmi's blessings.</p>

              <h3>Lotus Flower Symbolism</h3>
              <p>Lakshmi sits on a lotus flower, which blooms in muddy water yet remains pure. This teaches that prosperity should be earned righteously and that purity of character is essential.</p>

              <h3>Offerings Meaning</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Flowers:</strong> Beauty and temporary nature of life</li>
                <li><strong>Incense:</strong> Our prayers reaching the divine</li>
                <li><strong>Lamps:</strong> Inner light and knowledge</li>
                <li><strong>Sweets:</strong> Joy and celebration</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Deeper Spiritual Meaning</h3>
              <p>Lakshmi Puja isn't just about asking for money. It's about inviting prosperity in all its forms: health, knowledge, peace, happiness, and righteousness. It's about becoming worthy of blessings through virtue and hard work.</p>

                <li>Spiritual advancement and enlightenment</li>
                <li>Moral integrity and righteousness (dharma)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>The Cycle of Abundance</h3>
              <p>Hindu philosophy teaches that abundance circulates. When you receive blessings, you should share with others. This creates a cycle of generosity and continued prosperity.</p>

              <h3>The Role of Effort</h3>
              <p>Lakshmi doesn't come to the lazy. The puja is combined with:
              <ul>
                <li>Hard work and dedication</li>
                <li>Ethical conduct and honesty</li>
                <li>Generosity and sharing</li>
                <li>Gratitude for what you have</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Meditation on Prosperity</h3>
              <p>During Lakshmi Puja, devotees contemplate their own relationship with prosperity. What kind of wealth do you truly need? What would make your life prosperous?</p>

              <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
              <p>Lakshmi Puja is the spiritual heart of Diwali. It's a ceremony of invitation, gratitude, and aspiration. Whether you participate fully, observe respectfully, or simply appreciate the meaning, Lakshmi Puja connects you to thousands of years of spiritual tradition.</p>
              <p>The most important element isn't perfect Sanskrit pronunciation or elaborate offerings. It's the sincere intention to invite goodness, prosperity, and light into your life and the lives of those you love.</p>
              <p><strong>May Lakshmi's blessings shine upon you. May prosperity, in all its forms, flourish in your life.</strong></p>
