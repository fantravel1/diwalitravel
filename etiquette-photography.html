              <h2>Sensitive Situations</h2>

              <h3>During Prayers</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't photograph:</strong> People praying, intimate spiritual moments</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> Disruptive, disrespectful, breaks concentration</li>
                <li><strong>Instead:</strong> Experience the moment; memories are better than photos sometimes</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Vulnerable People</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Elderly people:</strong> Extra respect; ask clearly and kindly</li>
                <li><strong>Children:</strong> Never without parent/guardian permission</li>
                <li><strong>People in traditional dress:</strong> They may feel self-conscious; ask kindly</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Poverty or Informal Settings</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Be thoughtful about photographing people in humble settings</li>
                <li>Ask permission; respect their dignity</li>
                <li>Don't photograph as "exotica" or entertainment</li>
                <li>Be genuinely respectful of their situation</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Tourist Photography vs. Respectful Photography</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Tourist photography:</strong> Quick, surface-level, sometimes disrespectful</li>
                <li><strong>Respectful photography:</strong> Asks permission, understands context, respectful sharing</li>
                <li><strong>Be the latter:</strong> It shows respect and creates better photos</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Photography Etiquette FAQ</h2>
              <h3>Can I photograph inside temples?</h3>
              <p>Varies by temple. Look for signs, ask staff. Many allow photography in common areas but not during prayers or in inner sanctums. Always ask first.</p>

              <h3>What if there's a "No Photography" sign?</h3>
              <p>Respect it completely. The sign is there for a reason (protecting sanctity, respecting privacy, etc.). Don't photograph anyway.</p>

              <h3>Can I use flash in temples?</h3>
              <p>Usually no. Flash is disruptive during prayers and ceremonies. Many temples explicitly forbid it. Use natural light or increase ISO instead.</p>

              <h3>Is it okay to photograph strangers on the street?</h3>
              <p>In public celebrations, generally yes, but best practice is to ask if you're focused on individuals. Candid wide shots of crowds usually don't require permission.</p>

              <h3>Can I photograph children I don't know?</h3>
              <p>No. Always get parent/guardian permission. Period. This is both respectful and legally important.</p>

              <h3>Can I post photos of other people on social media?</h3>
              <p>Best practice: ask permission first, especially if they're central to the photo. It's respectful and appreciates their image rights.</p>

              <h3>What about photographing food?</h3>
              <p>Usually appreciated! People are often proud of their cooking. Just ask: "Can I photograph this?" It shows you care about their effort.</p>

              <h3>Can I photograph rangoli and share on social media?</h3>
              <p>Yes, but credit the artist if possible. Ask where you photographed it, what inspired it, and share that context.</p>

            <section class="article-section">
              <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
              <p>Photography is a way to preserve memories and share experiences. But it's also about respecting people, spaces, and culture. The best photographers are those who ask permission, respect boundaries, and capture moments authentically while honoring the people and places they photograph.</p>
              <p>Remember: <strong>The moment itself is more important than the photo. Be present, be respectful, and let the photos come naturally from genuine connection.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Photograph respectfully. Share thoughtfully. Honor the culture.</strong></p>
