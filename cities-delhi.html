            <!-- Air Quality -->
            <section class="article-section">
              <h2>Air Quality &amp; Health Considerations</h2>
              <p>Delhi's air quality is a real concern during Diwali. Firecrackers combined with seasonal crop burning in Punjab and Haryana can create hazardous conditions.</p>
              <p><strong>AQI Reality:</strong> During Diwali 2025, Delhi's AQI reached 450+ (hazardous level). This is typical. By Nov 9-10, it can spike even higher.</p>
              <h3>Protective Measures:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Carry N95 or N99 masks at all times.</li>
                <li>Choose hotels with air purifiers and HEPA filters.</li>
                <li>Limit outdoor activities between 7 PM - 8 AM (peak firecracker hours).</li>
                <li>Monitor real-time AQI via IQAir app or SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting).</li>
                <li>Consider visiting on Nov 6-7 when air is still good, then move to a cleaner city like Jaipur for Nov 8-10.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Health Alert:</strong> If you have asthma or respiratory issues, consult your doctor before planning Diwali in Delhi.</p>

            <section class="article-section">
              <h2>Delhi Diwali FAQ</h2>
              <h3>Is it safe to travel to Delhi during Diwali?</h3>
              <p>Yes, Delhi is generally safe for travelers during Diwali. However, be prepared for crowds, congestion, and air quality issues. Avoid isolated areas late at night, use registered transportation, and follow local guidance on air quality.</p>

              <h3>How bad is the air quality in Delhi during Diwali?</h3>
              <p>Air quality can reach hazardous levels (AQI 400+) on Diwali night and the following days due to firecrackers and seasonal crop burning. If you have respiratory issues, consider visiting another city or staying indoors with air purifiers.</p>

              <h3>What's the best hotel area to stay in Delhi?</h3>
              <p>For first-time visitors seeking comfort, New Delhi or South Delhi are best. For immersive experience, stay in or near Old Delhi (Jama Masjid area). Book 4-6 months in advance.</p>

              <h3>Can I visit markets on Diwali night itself?</h3>
              <p>Most markets close or wind down by evening on Diwali night as business owners go home to celebrate with family. Visit markets on Nov 6-7 for the full shopping experience.</p>

              <h3>Do I need to be Hindu to participate in Diwali celebrations?</h3>
              <p>Absolutely not. Diwali is a festival of light celebrated by people of all faiths. Visitors and non-Hindus are warmly welcomed to participate respectfully.</p>
